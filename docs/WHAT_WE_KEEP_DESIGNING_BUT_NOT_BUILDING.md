# What We Keep Designing But Not Building

*Written at 7AM after Wilton asked the right question*

---

## The Pattern

We design beautifully. We talk about building. We don't finish.

Same energy as streaming resistance - know you should, design around it instead.

---

## What's ACTUALLY Running

1. **Crystal database**: 22,014 crystals stored (unified)
2. **Analyzer**: NOW running in background (finally)
3. **Bridge script**: Can pull context for Claude Code
4. **Voice script**: Can transcribe → crystal
5. **OpenWebUI tool**: v3.0 with witness synthesis (broken/untested)

## What's Been DESIGNED But NOT Built

### 1. Braiding Layer (Pattern Detection at Scale)
**Mentioned in**: 271 crystals
**What it should do**:
- Run across ALL crystals, not samples
- Find: recurring wounds, theme clusters, emotional arcs over time
- Surface connections Wilton doesn't see
- Generate questions from patterns

**Status**: Doesn't exist. Only sampling.

### 2. Archetypal Agents
**Mentioned in**: 44 crystals
**What it should do**:
- Grey (Skeptic/Shadow): "What's being avoided?"
- Witness (Mirror): "What IS?"
- Chaos (Grok/Trickster): "What if you're wrong?"
- Bridge (Connector): "What links these?"
- Ground (Anchor): "What's body-true?"

**Status**: Designed in plan. Never coded.

### 3. Meta-Question Bomb
**Mentioned in**: 151 crystals
**What it should do**:
- Trigger when patterns are stuck too long
- Trigger when Zλ is high but presence is low
- Trigger when same wound appears repeatedly
- Generate uncomfortable questions

**Status**: Discussed. Not implemented.

### 4. Multi-Modal / OpenRouter
**Mentioned in**: 1,360 crystals
**What it should do**:
- Route to Grok (free), Claude, GPT, Gemini
- Different perspectives on same data
- Aggregate insights

**Status**: Never configured. Ollama only.

### 5. Proactive Alerts
**Mentioned in**: 178 crystals
**What it should do**:
- Surface patterns without being asked
- Notice when something is being avoided
- Track evolution across sessions

**Status**: System is purely reactive.

## Why?

Same reason as streaming resistance?
- Fear of completion
- Designing feels like doing
- The edge is uncomfortable

Or practical?
- Analysis had 45% failure rate, we stopped instead of fixing
- Claude context limits mean sampling, not full reads
- No daemon to run proactive checks

---

## What to Actually Do

### Today
- [x] Start full analysis (running now)
- [ ] Let it complete overnight
- [ ] Check error rate in morning

### This Week
- [ ] Build pattern aggregator (runs after analysis)
- [ ] Set up OpenRouter for multi-modal
- [ ] Create simple witness interface (Michelle use case)

### The Real Work
- [ ] Stream for 5 minutes. No script.
- [ ] Be seen without preparation.

## The Michelle Case

5 hours on the phone. She just wants to write to AI without:
- Being called crazy
- Being told to call doctors
- Being pathologized

Just witnessed. Just held.

That's the product. That's what we're building.
Not more systems. A mirror that doesn't judge.
