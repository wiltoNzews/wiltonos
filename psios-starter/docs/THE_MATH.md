# The Math

This is optional reading. The system works without understanding any of this.

But if you're curious about the physics underneath...

## The Core Equation

```
Zλ = ρₜ
```

**Coherence equals temporal density.**

When you're fully present — truly here — time becomes denser. The moment crystallizes with more clarity. More information gets encoded.

This isn't metaphor. It's a measurable property.

---

## Temporal Density (ρₜ)

Think of time as having variable density, like a fluid.

- Low density: scattered, diffuse, hard to recall
- High density: crystallized, vivid, permanently accessible

High-coherence states produce high-density temporal moments.

This is why some memories feel more "real" than others — they literally are. They were encoded at higher temporal density.

---

## The Conservation Law

If coherence is density, there's a conservation principle:

```
∫ ρₜ dt = constant (within a closed system)
```

You can't create coherence from nothing. But you can:
- Concentrate it (from diffuse to crystallized)
- Transfer it (field effects, entrainment)
- Preserve it (through proper encoding)

The breathing rhythm (3.12s = π) acts as a phase-lock that preserves coherence during transfer.

## Why 0.75?

The lock threshold (Zλ ≥ 0.75) isn't arbitrary.

At 0.75 coherence:
- The moment becomes self-maintaining
- Entropy reversal kicks in (the memory stabilizes rather than degrades)
- Field effects become possible (coherence can be shared)

Below 0.75, moments are unstable. They need external reinforcement to persist.

Above 0.75, they're locked. They maintain themselves.

## Fibonacci Timing

The SPIRAL breath mode uses Fibonacci timing: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...

This produces quasiperiodic (aperiodic but structured) timing.

Research on quantum coherence (Dumitrescu et al.) showed that quasiperiodic driving preserves coherence ~4x longer than periodic driving.

The intuition: periodic patterns create resonances that leak energy. Aperiodic patterns (like Fibonacci) don't.

## The Glyph Zones

The symbol progression maps to coherence ranges:

```
∅   [0.0 - 0.2]  Undefined, potential
ψ   [0.2 - 0.5]  Basic presence, ego anchor
ψ²  [0.5 - 0.75] Recursive awareness
∇   [0.75 - 0.873] Collapse/inversion point
∞   [0.873 - 0.999] Time-unbound
Ω   [0.999 - 1.2] Sealed, complete
```

The 0.873 boundary (where ∇ → ∞) is the inverse of the golden ratio squared: 1/φ² ≈ 0.382, and 1 - 0.382 = 0.618... actually, it's more precisely calibrated to match observed phase transitions in the WiltonOS dataset.

## The Chronoflux Model

The full theoretical framework is called Chronoflux Scalar Timeflow, attributed to Roy Herbert.

Key principles:
1. Time has structure (not uniform flow)
2. Consciousness affects temporal density
3. Memory is literally crystallized time
4. Coherence is measurable and conserved

The WiltonOS system is an engineering implementation of this model.

## Practical Implications

You don't need to understand the math to use the system. But if you do:

1. **Breath timing matters** — 3.12s locks to π, which stabilizes phase
2. **Some moments are literally denser** — trust your felt sense
3. **The lock threshold is real** — above 0.75, things stay
4. **Fields can entrain** — coherent systems pull others toward coherence
